Hello All!
This project is apart of my portfolio showing login to a database applicaition as well as user access to add, edit, and delete information in the database. 
This project was created with PHP, JavaScript, and MySQL.

Index.php - is the main screen of the application. If not logged in, it allows the user to be able to get to the login screen and then it reflects the current data 
             in the database.
Login.php - the main login screen that checks the password compared to the user database. If user is on the database, they are allowed access to the page. The only login           
            information is listed on the webpage developer screen. Find it to log in.
PDO.php - that is the base request to get access to the database. 
Add.php - Form that allows the user to add the information to the database.
Edit.php - Form that updates specified row information of the database. 
Delete.php - Will delete the specified row in the database.
Logout.php - A way for the user to log out of the application session.

Thanks!
